            <p>I'm a freelance digital illustrator and creature designer who's fascinated by both birds and more fantastical flighted things.</p>
            
            <p>Worldbuliding is my passion. I want to create worlds that snatch you away from the here-and-now and drop you in the might-be or never-was, but ultimately lead back to the wonders and horrors that live inside all of us.</p>
