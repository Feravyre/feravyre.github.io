            cohesive worldbuilding
            
            <p>I'm a freelance digital illustrator and creature designer. I am fascinated by birds and fantastical flighted things.</p>
            
            <p>I want to create worlds that snatch you away from the here-and-now and drop you in the might-be or never-was, but ultimately lead back to the wonders and horrors that live inside of us all.</p>
