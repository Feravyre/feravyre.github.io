<p class="text-upper">To commission me, you will need to agree to the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="tos-list">
<li>Payment is accepted via Paypal or Ko-fi and prices are listed in USD. All paypal or other transactional fees will be covered by me, the artist. Commissioners are never responsible for paying surcharges to cover these fees.</li>
<li>Finished artwork will be delivered via the original point of contact, and a copy will be sent to the commissioner's Paypal email, if different.</li>
<li>If I cannot complete a commission for any reason, the commissioner will be promptly contacted via the original point of contact and fully refunded.</li>
<li>If I am awaiting a response or approval from a commissioner for longer than two weeks, their commission will be cancelled and refunded.</li>
<li>Commissoners may request a refund before a commission is complete, but the refunded amount will reflect the work that has already been done. This incomplete work will be provided to the commissioner to do with as they wish.</li>
<li>Commissioners may reupload or repost their completed commissions only if proper credit is given; commissioners may not claim commissioned artwork as their own creation.</li>
<li>Commissioned artwork may be posted to my social media and/or portfolio at my discretion unless otherwise is specifically requested by the commissioner.</li>
<li>Prices listed on this site are for noncommercial inquiries only; commercial projects will be required to pay a commercial licensing fee. This fee will vary depending on the nature and scale of the project.</li>
